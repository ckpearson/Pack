<p>Pack is a super-simple app that lets you share relatively small files with other people by using images as the transport medium.</p>

<p>Many times (take GitHub for example!) you want to share a simple file, say a word document, a spreadsheet or other such files, but the system you're using doesn't accommodate file uploads, Pack lets you share the data using a convenient image instead!</p>

<p>Pack takes the file you want to share, compresses it a bit and then produces an image that contains that data; to get the data out again someone just needs to pass the image back through Pack and out comes the file (filename too!)</p>

<p>This is a free tool for anyone to use, but I make no claims as to its fitness for any particular purpose, nor do I accept any liability or offer any sort of warranty for anything occurring as a result of using Pack (or associated items such as the installer etc) - this includes but is not limited to: loss of data, damage to hardware or software, monetary loss as a result of using the software.</p>
