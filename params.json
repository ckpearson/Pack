{"name":"Pack","tagline":"Sharing files through images.","body":"### Welcome to Pack\r\n\r\nPack is a super-simple app that lets you share relatively small files with other people by using images as the transport medium.\r\n\r\nMany times (take GitHub for example!) you want to share a simple file, say a word document, a spreadsheet or other such files, but the system you're using doesn't accommodate file uploads, Pack lets you share the data using a convenient image instead!\r\n\r\nPack takes the file you want to share, compresses it a bit and then produces an image that contains that data; to get the data out again someone just needs to pass the image back through Pack and out comes the file (filename too!)\r\n\r\n#### Terms of Use (Boring Legal Butt-Covering)\r\n\r\nThis is a free tool for anyone to use, but I make no claims as to its fitness for any particular purpose, nor do I accept any liability or offer any sort of warranty for anything occurring as a result of using Pack (or associated items such as the installer etc) - this includes but is not limited to: loss of data, damage to hardware or software, monetary loss as a result of using the software.\r\n\r\n#### Credits\r\n\r\nUses a number of open-source libraries including:\r\n\r\n* [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro)\r\n* [Reactive UI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)\r\n* [SevenZipSharp](http://sevenzipsharp.codeplex.com/)\r\n* [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows)\r\n\r\nApp Icon provided by the fantastic [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
